# PC-Mania

The PC Mania is the Coursework website built using Flask with interactive and user-friendly design to help them build their own custom PC without any troubles.

## Description

The "PC-Mania" PC Designer website was developed. The main programming language is Python. The website is created on the basis of Flask and aims to simplify the difficult choice of people who want to assemble a computer on their own, but do not have sufficient knowledge about all the nuances of compatibility, recommendations for choosing components, and more. The developed website contains a convenient interface.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- MySQL Database
- SQL Alchemy for ORM control over the database

## Local Usage

To use the website locally, do the following steps:

1. Open the terminal in desired folder.
2. Run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siriknikita/PC-Mania.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

3. Open the provided link next to the **Running on** text.
4. Build your first custom PC without any issues!

## Lessons Learned

1. A new way of thinking about project structure and the problems I want to solve via developing the website.
2. A deep understanding of deployment, as well as it's importance in the development cycle.
3. Work on the database structure to make the efficiend and comfortable work on the development stage.
4. Usage of new technologies and concepts, such as ORM, MVC and MVT patterns, SQL Injections, etc.

## Future of Project

In order to grow, I am planning to improve the following concepts of the website:

1. **Refactor the code**: the code structure have to be maintainable and reliable.
2. **Improve database structure**: the important part of the website is the database, which needs to be refactored and restructured.
3. **Safety measurements**: another important thing is safety, and the safety measurements can be improved via advanced ways of Authentication flow, as well as using cloud providers to increase the safety of the database instead of containing it's creation only on the local computer.
