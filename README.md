## LESSONS LEARNED
1. A new way of thinking about project structure and the problems I want to solve via developing the website.
2. A deep understanding of deployment, as well as it's importance in the development cycle.
3. Work on the database structure to make the efficiend and comfortable work on the development stage.
4. Usage of new technologies and concepts, such as ORM, MVC and MVT patterns, SQL Injections, etc.
## FUTURE OF PROJECT
In order to grow, I am planning to improve the following concepts of the website:
1. **Refactor the code**: the code structure have to be maintainable and reliable.
2. **Improve database structure**: the important part of the website is the database, which needs to be refactored and restructured.
3. **Safety measurements**: another important thing is safety, and the safety measurements can be improved via advanced ways of Authentication flow, as well as using cloud providers to increase the safety of the database instead of containing it's creation only on the local computer.
